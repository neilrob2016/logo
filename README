Introduction
------------
LOGO is a language based very losely on Lisp that controls a "turtle" that
response to drawing commands that is designed to teach children the basics of
programming. The turtle can either be on screen (as in this version) or real.
As such it is not a fully featured language missing obvious functionality such
as file I/O and networking. In my opinion once a child understands the concepts
of programming well enough to wish to use this missing functionality then they
are probably better off moving to a more "grown up" fully featured language 
such as Python or BASIC.


Compiling
---------
The code is written in C++ 2011 and has been tested and compiled on Linux and
MacOS, the latter requiring XQuartx and the X windows development libraries
and headers to be installed. To compile the code simply type "make".


Documentation
-------------
Please see the docs directory for important programming documentation.


Example code
------------
There is an example code directory that has some procedures that given you an
idea of how things work and some of the language functionality.
