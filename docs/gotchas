A few things which might catch out the unwary.

1)
Passing negative numbers as parameters to procedures can produce errors. Eg:

? pops
User procedures
---------------
TO test :a :b 
	PRN "A = " :a ", b = " :b
END

? test 1 -2
ERROR 7: Missing argument(s) at "test"

The reason this occurs is because anything following a procedure is
evaluated as an expression first THEN passed as parameters. Here the
expression is being evaluated is 1-2, not 1, -2. To solve this problem put
negative numbers in brackets so it is treated as a seperate expression. Eg:

? test 1 (-2)
A = 1, b = -2
?

This problem also occurs with built in system procedures. Eg:

? setpos -10 -10
ERROR 7: Missing argument(s) at "setpos"
? setpos -10 (-10)
?


2)
NRJ-LOGO uses standard quoted strings unlike other versions of the language 
which only support individual words which then have to be concatenated together.
For example to set the variable 'str' to a string:

Dr Logo : MAKE "str (SE "hello "cruel "world)
NRJ-LOGO: MAKE "str" "hello cruel world"

I felt that quoted strings were simpler for children to understand and hence
the SE(ntence) command does not exist in NRJ-LOGO.
