                             *** OPERATORS ***

LOGO has a number of built in operators all of which are self evident except
for the ones that are annotated:

Logical
=======
   NOT
   AND  : This does lazy evaluation
   OR
   XOR
   =
   <>   : Not equals
   <
   >
   <=
   >=
   
Mathematical
============
   +
   -
   *
   /
   %   : Modulus. Eg: 10 % 3 = 1
   ^   : Power.   Eg: 10^2 = 100
